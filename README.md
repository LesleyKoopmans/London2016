###This is my first app
This is the first app I am trying to make. The app is mostly for learning purpuses and will not be live on the app store. 
Most of the things I use are from the Devslopes courses by Mark Price on Udemy. 

#####An app about London
Since me and my girlfriend live for one year in London I would like to make this app as some sort of diary. Also this app will keep track of things we would like to do in our remaining time. 
The app is mostly about our personal experience. 

#####Questions
Also this README file is for testing, so I can learn how to use GitHub, Git and the terminal.
If you have any questions or recomendations/improvements you can contact me on lesleykoopmans@gmail.com
